[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emraher/wildcatdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emraher/wildcatdown)

This project provides a template for writing a PhD thesis in R Markdown, and rendering those files into a PDF formatted according to [the requirements of the Kansas State University](https://www.k-state.edu/grad/etdr/etdr-handbook.pdf). It uses the [Kansas State University Thesis class](https://www.k-state.edu/grad/etdr/template/latex_source.zip) to convert R Markdown files into a PDF formatted ready for submission at KSU. This project was inspired by the [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown), [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown), and [huskydown](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown) packages.

Currently, the PDF and gitbook versions are fully-functional. The word and epub versions are developmental, have no templates behind them, and are essentially calls to the appropriate functions in bookdown.

If you are new to working with `bookdown` and `rmarkdown`, please read over the documentation available in wildcatdown [PDF template](index/_book/thesis.pdf) and the [bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

Under the hood, the [Kansas State University Thesis LaTeX template](https://www.k-state.edu/grad/etdr/template/latex_source.zip) is used to ensure that documents conform precisely to submission standards. At the same time, composition and formatting can be done using lightweight [markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) syntax, and **R** code and its output can be seamlessly included using [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

## Using wildcatdown to write your PhD thesis

Using **wildcatdown** has some prerequisites which are described below. To compile PDF documents using **R**, you need to have LaTeX installed. It can be downloaded for Windows at <http://http://miktex.org/download> and for OSX at <http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html>.  Follow the instructions to install the necessary packages after downloading the (somewhat large) installer files. You may need to install a few extra LaTeX packages on your first attempt to knit as well.

We use some fonts, [EB Garamond](https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond), [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/) and [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/), that all are freely available online if you don't have them already. You should install these before proceeding. 

On a Linux system, this should give you what you need:

```
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex -y 
sudo apt-get install texlive-bibtex-extra biber -y 
sudo apt-get install fonts-ebgaramond -y 
wget https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/archive/1.017R.zip 
unzip 1.017R.zip  
sudo cp source-code-pro-1.017R/OTF/*.otf /usr/local/share/fonts/ 
sudo apt-get install fonts-lato -y 
```

On an OSX system, assuming [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) and [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) are installed and updated, this will get you the fonts and other LaTeX packages needed for this template:

```
brew update
brew tap caskroom/fonts
brew cask install font-eb-garamond font-source-code-pro font-lato
sudo tlmgr update --self
sudo tlmgr install biblatex titling titlesec quotchap lettrine appendix units tocloft draftwatermark everypage wasysym logreq xstring collection-fontsrecommended texliveonfly 
```

On Windows the usual pointing and clicking is required to download and install [LaTeX](http://http://miktex.org/download) and the fonts listed above. 

To use **wildcatdown** from RStudio:

1) Assuming you have already installed LaTeX and the fonts described above, install the latest version of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You can use wildcatdown without RStudio. For example, you can write the Rmd files in your favourite text editor (e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)). But RStudio is probably the easiest tool for writing both R code and text in your thesis. 

2) Install the **bookdown** and **wildcatdown** packages: 

```
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.org")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
devtools::install_github("emraher/wildcatdown")
```

3) Use the **New R Markdown** dialog to select **Thesis**, here are the steps, and a screenshot below:

File -> New File -> R Markdown... then choose 'From template', then choose 'KSU-Thesis, and enter `index` as the **Name**. Note that this will currently only **Knit** if you name the directory `index` at this step.

Or if you're not using RStudio, run this line to create a new PhD thesis from the template:

```r
rmarkdown::draft('index.Rmd', template = 'thesis', package = 'wildcatdown', create_dir = TRUE)
```


4) Edit the individual chapter R Markdown files to write your thesis.

## Rendering

To render your thesis, open `index.Rmd` in RStudio and then hit the
"knit" button. To change the output formats between PDF, gitbook and Word ,
look at the `output:` field in `index.Rmd`and comment-out the formats 
you don't want.

Alternatively, if you're not using RStudio, you can use this from the R console:

```r
bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', wildcatdown::thesis_pdf(latex_engine = 'xelatex'))
```

Your thesis will be deposited in the `_book/` directory.

## Components

The following components are ones you should edit to customize your thesis:

### `_bookdown.yml`

This is the main configuration file for your thesis. Arrange the order of your
chapters in this file and ensure that the names match the names in your folders. 
### `index.Rmd`

This file contains all the meta information that goes at the beginning of your
document. You'll need to edit this to put your name in, the title of your thesis, etc.

### `01-chap1.Rmd`, etc.

These are the Rmd files for each chapter in your dissertation. Write your thesis in these. If you're writing in RStudio, you may find the [wordcount addin](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin) useful for getting word counts and readability statistics in R markdown documents. 

### `bib/`

Store your bibliography (as bibtex files) here. We recommend using the [citr addin](https://github.com/crsh/citr) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to 
efficiently manage and insert citations. 

### `csl/`

Specific style files for bibliographies should be stored here. A good source for
citation styles is https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles#readme

### `figure/` and `data/`

Store your figures and data here and reference them in your R Markdown files.
